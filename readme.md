# Backbone.BabySitter

Manage child views in a Backbone.View.

## About Backbone.BabySitter

Backbone provides a lot of functionality in it's views, but does not directly
provide a way to manage child views or nested views. This is not terribly
difficult to do on your own, but it gets tedious to write the same code
over and over again.

Backbone.BabySitter provides a simple way to manage an unknown number of
child views within a Backbone.View, or other object that needst to track a
list of views.
